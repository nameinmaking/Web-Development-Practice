##Re-visiting JavaScript/ECMAScript

###Overview
JavaScript is a multi-paradigm, dynamic language with types and operators, standard built-in objects, and methods. Its syntax is based on the Java and C languages — many structures from those languages apply to JavaScript as well. JavaScript supports object-oriented programming with object prototypes, instead of classes. JavaScript also supports functional programming — functions are objects, giving functions the capacity to hold executable code and be passed around like any other object.
